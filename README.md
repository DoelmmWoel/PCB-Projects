## :grey_question: FAQ

- Why did I start making circuit boards?
- I wanted to create something, that would include my work, my design and functionality, and to make it look clear and understanding.
- For what purpose do you make the boards the most?
- Most of the boards, are made for Flipper Zero mostly, if I get some creative ideas, I create something more unusual and entertaining.
- What do you use to make them?
- I use EasyEDA for making circuits sometimes KiCad 7.0, and JLCPCB for ordering them. The deliveries take longer as I take the Global Standart Direct Line.
- What colors are you mostly focused on and will you make different colors?
- Black, thats just my preference and the bird logo.
- What is the history of the bird?
- When I was working, making homeworks basically for informatic technologies, I managed to put the pencils and pens in specific order and algorithm to make the bird, and thats how the bird logo appeared.
- How old are you?
- I am born in 2008 April 26, so it's obvious.
- Do you make your own DIY SD Cards
- Not yet.
- Tell about your Flippe Zero.
- I have white Flipper Zero, the dolphin name is Coydetna. I mostly use Xtreme or Unleashed firmwares, I create my DIY boards for it, but I don't really show off.
- Do you use your Flipper Zero for remote because you couldn't find 2 AA batteries.
- No, I don't use it as a crappy infrared remote, because I'm not 70yr old that forgot AA batteries.
- Will you make the circuits by suggestions of offers?
- I might will do, one day.
- What was your very first ever project created?
- DIY rubbery ducky that uses DigiSpark ATtiny85 with modifications.
- Android or iOS?
- I own both, and I don't participate in the wars, phone is a phone.
- Linux or Windows?
- Windows for work and gaming, linux testing, finding vulnerabilities overall linux is better by design.
