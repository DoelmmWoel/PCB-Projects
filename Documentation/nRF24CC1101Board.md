<h1>nRF24/CC1101 Board</h1>
<p>The Flipper Zero nRF24/CC1101 Board is a versatile and powerful accessory designed to enhance the functionality of the Flipper Zero device. It combines the capabilities of the nRF24 module and the CC1101 module, offering a wide range of functions to cater to various applications. In this documentation, we will primarily focus on the functions of the nRF24 module, highlighting its features and capabilities. The nRF24 module is a key component of the Flipper Zero nRF24/CC1101 Board, and it is primarily known for its wireless communication capabilities. Some of the key functions and features of the nRF24 module include: Batch Mode: The nRF24 module supports batch operations, enabling users to send and receive data in packets efficiently. This feature is particularly useful for applications where data needs to be transmitted in bulk. Channel Scanner: With its channel scanning capabilities, the nRF24 module allows users to detect and identify available communication channels. This is vital for optimizing the use of the available frequency spectrum, especially in crowded or interference-prone environments. Sniffer Mode: The nRF24 module can function as a sniffer, allowing users to monitor and analyze wireless communication traffic. This is invaluable for debugging and security analysis. Mouse Jacking: The nRF24 module can be utilized for mouse jacking, a technique used in some penetration testing scenarios. It allows for the manipulation of wireless mice and keyboards, highlighting potential security vulnerabilities. Scanner Mode: The scanner mode is used to actively search for and identify other nRF24-compatible devices in the vicinity. This can be particularly helpful for mapping and identifying wireless networks and devices. Additionally, the Flipper Zero nRF24/CC1101 Board is equipped with the CC1101 module, which extends the range of the Flipper Zero device. This feature makes it possible to communicate over longer distances, making the board even more versatile and suitable for various applications. In summary, the nRF24 module in the Flipper Zero nRF24/CC1101 Board offers an array of functions, including batch operations, channel scanning, sniffing, mouse jacking, and scanning. With the added benefit of the CC1101 module extending the communication range, this board is a valuable tool for a wide range of wireless communication and security-related tasks. Its adaptability and features make it a must-have for anyone looking to expand the capabilities of their Flipper Zero device.</p>
